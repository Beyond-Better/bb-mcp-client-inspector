# Client Tracking Quick Start

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ Full Client Tracking System

1. **Backend (bb-mcp-server library)**:
   - Client session tracking for HTTP (multiple clients) and STDIO (single client)
   - Extracts client name, version, protocol from initialize request
   - Captures `_meta` field from all client‚Üíserver requests
   - Tracks connection time, activity, request count
   - Unified API through TransportManager

2. **Frontend (Inspector Console)**:
   - ClientSelector component showing all connected clients
   - Visual selection with highlighted borders and checkmark
   - Auto-selects first client when available
   - All forms (Notification, Sampling, Elicitation) target selected client
   - Displays client metadata including `_meta` indicator

## Before Testing - Format Code

```bash
# Format Fresh UI
cd fresh-ui
deno fmt

# Format MCP Server  
cd ../mcp-server
deno fmt

# Return to root
cd ..
```

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Start the MCP Server (HTTP mode)

```bash
cd mcp-server
MCP_TRANSPORT=http deno task dev

# Should see:
# ‚úÖ MCP Client Inspector Server started successfully!
# üì° Transport: http
# üåê HTTP endpoint: http://localhost:3030/mcp
# üîå WebSocket console: ws://localhost:3030/ws/console
```

### 2. Start the Fresh UI

```bash
# In another terminal
cd fresh-ui
deno task dev

# Should see:
# Listening on http://localhost:8000/
```

### 3. Open Console in Browser

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Green "Connected" indicator (WebSocket to MCP server)
- üì± Client Selector card (empty at first)
- üéÆ Command Panel with three tabs

### 4. Connect an MCP Client

Use the MCP Inspector or any MCP client:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:3030/mcp
```

Or connect programmatically with:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "Test Client",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "capabilities": {}
  }
}
```

### 5. Verify Client Appears

In the Console UI, you should now see:
- üì± Client appears in ClientSelector
- Shows client name and version
- Shows transport type (HTTP badge)
- Shows "0 requests" initially
- Auto-selected (highlighted with checkmark)

### 6. Test Client Targeting

**A. Send Notification**:
1. Click "üîî Notifications" tab
2. Select level, enter message
3. Click "Send Notification"
4. Check that sessionId is included in payload (browser console)

**B. Request Sampling**:
1. Click "üß† Sampling" tab
2. Enter a prompt: "What is 2+2?"
3. Click "Request Completion"
4. Check that sessionId is included in payload
5. MCP client should receive sampling request

**C. Request Elicitation**:
1. Click "‚ùì Elicitation" tab
2. Enter message: "Do you approve?"
3. Click "Request Approval"
4. Check that sessionId is included in payload
5. MCP client should receive elicitation request

### 7. Test _meta Capture

Send a request from MCP client with `_meta` field:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "echo",
    "arguments": {"message": "test"}
  },
  "_meta": {
    "sessionId": "abc123",
    "userId": "user@example.com",
    "custom": "data"
  }
}
```

Then in Console UI:
- Click "üîÑ Refresh" in ClientSelector
- Client should now show "[has _meta]" badge
- Request count should increment

## Troubleshooting

### Client Not Appearing
1. Check MCP server logs for session initialization
2. Verify client sent proper initialize request
3. Click Refresh button in ClientSelector
4. Check browser console for WebSocket messages

### sessionId Not Targeting
1. Verify client is selected (checkmark visible)
2. Check browser console for command payload
3. Check MCP server logs for sessionId in request
4. Remember: SDK may not support targeting yet (logged but not used)

### _meta Not Captured
1. Verify client is sending `_meta` in request body
2. Check MCP server logs for metadata extraction
3. Click Refresh to update client list
4. Badge only appears if `_meta` was present

## What's Next

### Immediate
- [ ] Format code (see commands above)
- [ ] Test with real MCP client
- [ ] Verify all targeting works

### Soon
- [ ] Add message filtering by selected client
- [ ] Show full `_meta` content on client details
- [ ] Add client disconnection notifications
- [ ] Update README with screenshots

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Client history (show disconnected clients)
- [ ] Request history per client
- [ ] Export client metadata
- [ ] Search/filter clients
- [ ] Multi-client selection (broadcast to multiple)
